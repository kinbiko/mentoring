- [ ] I have done a self-review before requesting a review from someone else.
- [ ] I believe the PR should not be brokend down into smaller PRs as it regards only one piece of work.
- [ ] I have provided a good title and description.
- [ ] I have raised any questions in Slack instead of in the PR or in comments in code.
- [ ] I have assigned a reviewer I believe has the background information needed to review this.

## Checklist for the reviewer

- [ ] I have been nice to the author in my review.
- [ ] I have been as clear as I can in my comments, and cannot think of a better way of formulating any of my comments.
- [ ] I have been constructive with my comments. I have provided alternatives to issues I've spotted, instead of just pointing out that they're wrong. 
- [ ] I have used inline comments when possible.
- [ ] I have used 'Request changes' only for changes where the author might wish to state a reason for a certain approach, or if I believe I should have a second look to verify everything is OK. I have approved the PR otherwise, with the understanding that my comments will be addressed.
- [ ] I have not been picky on personal code style when that's not the point of the PR
- [ ] I have tested the change locally if there's non-trivial code involved.
