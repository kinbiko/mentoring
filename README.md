# Mentoring

This repository contains lesson material for my mentoring efforts.

My students will be contributing their personal notes and reviewing each other's notes of topics from our sessions on a weekly basis.

## Contents

```
students -- lesson notes from each of my students, committed on a weekly basis.
lessons -- lesson material, slowly updated, derived from my students' notes, but organised and modified upon by myself
```

## Projects

Additionally, in the projects tab you'll find an attempt at outlining the entire syllabus as well as project boards for tracking the weekly progress of each of my students.
In the "Topics" project board you may add cards (not tickets please) of topics we've covered during our sessions or topics you'd like to cover that you believe I may help with.
Please make these knowledge topics, as opposed to chores that we had to do (e.g. "basic git concepts" is OK but "installing IntelliJ" is not.

## Reviews

Please use the `#review-requests` channel in Slack to ask the other students if they could review your notes when submitting a PR. You may use `@here`/`@channel` to get people's attention.
Please keep an eye on this channel, as reviewing other people's PRs is a great way to learn about new topics and practice human skills in software engineering teams.
If we have already gone over a topic in our lessons that someone else is requesting a review for, please volunteer.
If nobody has volunteered as a reviewer for your PR within 24 hours I will assign one based on my judgement of who I think would be a good fit.
I might assign you as a reviewer even if you have no knowledge of the topic.
This is common in industry as well -- there's always a first person on the team to learn something new.
