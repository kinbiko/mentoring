# SOLID Principles:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle **Most important**.
> A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.
> Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
> Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons. - Robert Martin
- Separation of concern
- Level of cohesion between elements in the class
1. **O**pen / Closed Principle
1. **L**iskov Substitution Principle
1. **I**nterface-Segregation Principle
1. **D**ependency Inversion Principle
