- Reviewing sprint project (issue) tasks and solving problems and feedback
- Reviewing main project tasks and planning next sprint

## Notes

Revision of Wallet code and improvements were made. We were talking about how to make Integration Test for the web Layer. Roger recommended to me [this article](https://spring.io/guides/gs/testing-web/)

We will see more about this after we work more with Mockito and TDD.

On class we made an exercise for TDD called String checker that consisted in to implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. 

In TDD we need test to pass the test, so we worry for make it run, not for correctness of code, correct code will happens automatically as long we keep writing tests that fail.

After it I had the homework to implement the [Bowling Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/) by using TDD.
