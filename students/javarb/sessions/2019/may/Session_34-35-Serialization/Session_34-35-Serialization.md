# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING IN JAVA

## Session 34 (21/05/2019 )

- Research homework [on my project](https://github.com/kinbiko/mentoring/projects/7) board.


## Notes

### Homework

#### Part 1
Figure out the most popular libraries for turning JSON strings into POJOs, and for turning POJOs into JSON.

#### Part 2
Write a simple project to benchmark their performance for serialization and serialization.

#### Part 3
Write a blog post (preferably in English) about what you discovered.


### Solution

#### Part 1

I found this [Top 5 Libraries for Serialization and Deserialization JSON in Java](https://simplesolution.dev/top-5-libraries-for-serialization-and-deserialization-json-in-java/). There they are mentioning following libraries:

- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson)
- [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)
- [Fastjson](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson)
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi)
- [Jsoniter](https://github.com/square/moshi)

I found [this other article](http://dgimenes.com/blog/2014/03/14/java-comparing-json-encoding-libraries.html) when the person who wrote is concluding that Gson and Jackson are best libraries but also is mentioning [JSON.org](http://json.org/) library which [seems to be obsolete now](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7623694). There in JSON.org, we can see these list of links to different Java libraries to handle serialization:

- JSON-java.
- JSONUtil.
- jsonp.
- Json-lib.
- Stringtree.
- SOJO.
- json-taglib.
- Flexjson.
- Argo.
- jsonij.
- fastjson.
- mjson.
- jjson.
- json-simple.
- json-io.
- google-gson.
- FOSS Nova JSON.
- Corn CONVERTER.
- Apache johnzon.
- Genson
- cookjson.
- progbase.

Stil is a extensive list it's strange Jackson isn't there.
